# Random Quiz Generator
This project contains two Python scripts that generate multiple-choice quizzes about U.S. state capitals. It includes:
1. **The original script** – a straightforward version based on the *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* exercise.
2. **An improved, more Pythonic version** – rewritten for clarity, maintainability, and modern best practices.

This README explains how both scripts work, highlights their differences, and provides usage instructions.
